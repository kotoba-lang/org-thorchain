(ns thorchain.memo
  "THORChain swap-memo construction, parsing and validation.

  THE MEMO *IS* THE TRANSACTION. A THORChain swap is an ordinary transfer to a
  vault address whose memo tells the network what to do with the funds — which
  asset to swap into, where to send the result, and (this is the part that pays
  for a wallet) which affiliate to skim basis points for. Get the memo wrong and
  the network refunds minus fees; get the destination field wrong and the funds
  go to the wrong address with no recourse. So this namespace parses and
  validates rather than formatting strings at call sites.

  GRAMMAR (verified 2026-07-26 against BOTH the THORNode parser source —
  gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode `x/thorchain/memo/memo_swap.go` — and the
  published memo docs, because the two disagree about the affiliate-bps ceiling;
  see `max-affiliate-bps` below):

    SWAP:ASSET:DESTADDR:LIM/INTERVAL/QUANTITY:AFFILIATE:FEE:DEX_AGG:DEX_ADDR:DEX_LIM
      0    1      2              3               4       5    6       7       8

  Only parts 0 and 1 are required. `SWAP` may be abbreviated `s` or `=`.
  AFFILIATE takes up to 5 `/`-separated THORNames; FEE takes either one bps
  value applied to all of them or one per affiliate.

  Pure `.cljc`, dual-platform, no network access."

(def swap-prefix
  "The shortest legal SWAP prefix. THORChain accepts `SWAP`, `s` and `=`; the
  short form is not a style choice — see `max-memo-bytes`."
  "=")

(def max-memo-bytes
  "80 bytes. A swap FROM Bitcoin carries its memo in an OP_RETURN, and the
  standard relay policy caps that at 80 bytes. A memo that overflows does not
  get truncated — the transaction does not relay, or it relays without a
  readable memo and the vault treats the funds as a donation. This is the single
  most expensive failure mode in the whole flow, which is why `build` refuses to
  emit an over-long memo instead of warning about one."

(def max-affiliate-bps
  "1000 bps (10%) — the ceiling the published memo docs state.

  THORNode's own validation is looser: it rejects only a TOTAL above 10000 bps
  (100%). This library defaults to the documented 1000 and requires an explicit
  `:allow-node-max? true` to go above it, because the failure mode of the loose
  reading is a wallet quietly charging a 50% fee that the network happily
  honours. If you need >10%, you are choosing that on purpose."
