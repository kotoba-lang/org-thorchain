  "THORChain asset notation: `CHAIN.SYMBOL` / `CHAIN.SYMBOL-CONTRACT`, plus the
  synth (`/`) and trade-account (`~`) variants. Pure `.cljc`, no dependencies.

  Asset notation is load-bearing, not cosmetic: it is the only thing in a swap
  memo that says WHICH asset the user gets. `ETH.USDC-0X…` and `AVAX.USDC-0X…`
  differ by one field and are different tokens on different chains, so this
  namespace parses and re-renders rather than doing string surgery at call
  sites."

;; Native gas assets of chains THORChain supports for BTC<->ETH-class flows.
;; Not an exhaustive registry — deliberately: a hard-coded \"supported assets\"
;; list goes stale silently as pools are added and churned. Ask the node
;; (`/thorchain/pools`) for what is actually tradeable right now; this map only
;; names the handful of gas assets whose spelling is worth pinning.

  "Single-token asset abbreviations THORNode ACTUALLY emits in the memos it
  returns, measured against a live node on 2026-07-26 by requesting a quote per
  asset and reading back `memo`:

    ETH.ETH   -> \"e\"        AVAX.AVAX -> \"a\"        DOGE.DOGE -> \"d\"
    BTC.BTC   -> \"b\"        THOR.RUNE -> \"r\"        BCH.BCH   -> \"c\"
                                                   LTC.LTC   -> \"l\"

  NOT measurable on 2026-07-26 and therefore ABSENT: `BSC.BNB` and `BASE.ETH`.
  Both chains were `halted: true` / `chain_trading_paused: true`, so a quote
  answers \"trading is halted\" and never reaches the point of emitting a memo.
  Omitted rather than guessed — re-measure when the halt lifts. (`SOL.SOL` was
  halted too, for the record.)

  Each Tier-2 address FORMAT was validated the same way: the network accepted a
  derived address as a destination for that chain. It rejects a malformed one
  (\"unable to parse address\"), which makes it a usable independent oracle — an
  early LTC attempt that reused Bitcoin's bech32 checksum was caught exactly that
  way.

  This table exists because a quote's memo is the thing that decides WHICH ASSET
  the user receives, and the node writes it in its own abbreviated dialect — so a
  verifier that only understands `CHAIN.SYMBOL` rejects every legitimate live
  memo. That was a real defect here until a live call exposed it.

  Only measured entries are listed. Other chains' shorthands are NOT guessed:
  `expand` returns nil for an unknown single token and the caller reports it
  loudly, because silently treating an unrecognized abbreviation as a match would
  mean accepting a memo that pays out a different asset. To extend it, request a
  quote for that asset against a node and read the abbreviation out of the memo —
  the same way these four were obtained.

  Contract tokens are abbreviated differently: the node drops the contract part
  entirely (`ETH.USDC-0XA0B8…EB48` -> `ETH.USDC`), which the chain+symbol
  comparison already tolerates without needing a table."
